# Simon Prince's book exercises solved.

My innitial objective was just to read some chapters where I felt the need to improve on in 2023, mainly transformers since I was implementing convolutional transformers or ViT. The author is so good at explaining concepts that I decided to complete all exercises during my free time.

Foundations are important and often do not come from university courses nor professional experience but actually personal hobby/work. Regardless of coming from the research side of AI, I think this was a great influence on my intuition blindspots and I'll continously post the solutions for all notebooks.
